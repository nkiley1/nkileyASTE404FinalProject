Forward Time, Centered Space and Crank Nicholson Solver Comparison for Transient 1-D Heat Transfer

To run this program, download ensure CN_Cool.py and FTCS_Cool.py are in the same folder as the analysis scripts. If you run NiceFigures.py, three figures will be generated, three time vs position graphs. The two with the plasma color gradient (orange/purple) are the base results. The blue/white/red one shows the difference between the CN results and the FTCS results.

If you run Error.py you will get a few graphs to assist with error analysis and comparison between the two. This one takes a bit to run since its running the codes at different timesteps, which takes a while.

If you run Comparison.py you will get some comparison graphs for one timestep.
