Forward Time, Centered Space and Crank Nicholson Solver Comparison for Transient 1-D Heat Transfer
To run this program, download CN_Cool.py, FTCS_Cool.py, and NiceFigures.py. If you run NiceFigures.py, three figures will be generated, three time vs position graphs. The two with the plasma color gradient (orange/purple) are the base results. The blue/white/red one shows the difference between the CN results and the FTCS results.
